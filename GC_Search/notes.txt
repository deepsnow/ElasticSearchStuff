Using this query

GET /gc-index/talk/_search
{
  "fields" : ["title", "author", "confid", "url"],
  "query" : {
    "match" : {
      "content" : "peace"
    }
  },
    "highlight" : {
      "fields" : {
        "content" : {"number_of_fragments": 50}
      }
    }
}

in sense (http://localhost:9200/_plugin/marvel/sense/index.html), I've learned that I really need to index only the text of the GC conf talks and not any of the HTML.

When all of the first 50 hits on "peace" from Elder's Perry's talk "FINDING LASTING PEACE AND BUILDING ETERNAL FAMILIES" come from markup, then that means there is way too much markup...

I need to download the PDFs and strip the text out of them, but how will I do that?

And, I need to figure out how to stop ES from returning the entire talk when it has hits. I just want the highlights...

how to delete in Sense? "DELETE gc-index"

I can build an index like this in Sense:

PUT gc-index
{
  "settings" : {
    "analysis" : {
      "analyzer" : {
        "remove_html" : {
          "tokenizer" : "standard",
          "char_filter" : [ "html_strip" ]
          }
        }
      }
    }
  
,
  
    "mappings" : {
      "talk" : {
        "properties" : {
          "title" : { "type": "string" },
          "author" : { "type": "string" },
          "confid" : { "type": "string" },
          "content" : { "type": "string", "analyzer": "remove_html" }
        }
      }
    }
  
}  

And, I can do it in code as well. See ESIndexOps.py and experimental_index_create.py.

Here's a way to test index settings: GET /gc-index/_settings,_mappings

I've succeeded in creating the index via python with the desired analyzer (with HTML char removal), and now I only 13 hits when I search for peace (as opposed to the 50 that I used to get according to the above?), but the hits still return the entire content of each talk as well as the individual hits in the highlights section.

How did it look before? I need to do a before and after test to see if my html removal made a positive difference...

I've discovered that my attempt toe create an index that uses the "html_strip" character filter analyzer does indeed work properly. (I compared a gc_index with the analyzer to a gc_index-2 without it and found that gc_index behaved as desired (returning only content hits and not markup hits).) That's great!!!

Now, where are the other conference talks published? I've asked Ronald to tell me where they can be found.

I'm still trying to load all of the GC talks that are available on lds.org (back to 1971). I can parse the archive page successfully, and I can load all of the talks from Apr 2015 and Oct 2014, but I error out on Apr 2014. Why? The second talk of that Conference has a title string with no author listed. It seems that I'm going to have to do a more complex parse if I want to get the title and author reliably.

Also, there are unicode characters in the <title> string that I am likely not handling properly at this point. They look badly when I output them to a text file... Will this happen when I get title and auther further down in the page?

OK, looking back at the output file, it appears that once Notepad++ refreshed the unicode chars were gone...? I can't see them any more...

Now that I'm handling the unicode chars as such, I can't display debugging output on the command line anymore because some of the chars won't render. Or, can I tell print the encoding?

Going to start on UI in special index containing only two Confs' worth of talks (Apr 2015 and Oct 2014). These can be found in ES index 'gc-index_2confs'.

What can I do to begin to build my UI?

What would need to change in the Python code to add a URL to my talk mapping?

How can I get ES to refraining from returning the entire talk content?
	Yes!!! The fields option to the search API. See http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9605292/make-elasticsearch-only-return-certain-fields.

Where can I get GC content from before 1971?

Tonight I've updated my python GC content retrieving code to also capture each talk's URL. This will be essential to my web app's ability to help users see the full text pertaining to any/all of their search hits.

Here's the Sense URL: http://localhost:9200/_plugin/marvel/sense/index.html

GET /gc/talk/_search
{
  "fields" : ["title", "author", "confid", "url"],
  "query" : {
    "match" : {
      "content" : "peace"
    }
  },
    "highlight" : {
      "fields" : {
        "content" : {"number_of_fragments": 50}
      }
    }
}
